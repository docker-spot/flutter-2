# Docker Spot - Flutter 2

You can use this in two ways either by command line or by VS Code extension.

## Assumption

I am using that you are familiar with,

- Docker

- ADB device connectivity

## Requirements

- If you are using VS Code extension then provided `devcontainer.json`. Docker Extension & Remote Development Extension.

- If you are using the command line then just use `Dockerfile`.

## Usage

After setting up everything like containers and phone connectivity, just run these commands in the container's workspace,

- `flutter create demo`

- `cd demo`

- `flutter run`
