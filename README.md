# Flutter 2

You can use this in two ways either by command line or by VS Code extension.

## Assumption

- I am using that you are familiar with the Docker and ADB device connectivity.

## Requirements

- If you are using VS Code extension then provided `devcontainer.json`. Docker Extension & Remote Development Extension.

OR

- Just use `Dockerfile`.

## Usage

After setting up everything like containers and phone connectivity, just run these commands in the container's workspace,

- `flutter create demo`.

- `cd demo`.

- `flutter run`.
